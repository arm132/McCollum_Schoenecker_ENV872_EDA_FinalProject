# Project question:
  Has the bird population of the Research Triangle increased in species richness over the past decade? Has that change been consistent across all three main counties in the area? How else has the population of the Triangle changed over the past decade?
  
# Analyses:
  Time Series of species totals for each of the three counties (Durham, Orange, Wake)
  Time Series of observer totals for each of the three counties
  Visualize SGCN and exotic spp totals from 2010-2019 (also divide by county?)
