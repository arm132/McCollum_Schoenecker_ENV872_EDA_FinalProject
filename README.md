## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository holds all the information for our final Environmental Data Analytics project (ENVIRON 872- Spring 2022). It's purpose is to illustrate our compotency in analyzing an environmental dataset using R and Rstudio. The dataset contains ebird information, a open-source citizen science project.

##### Project question
  The main question we seek to answer through the following analyses is Has the bird population of the Research Triangle increased in species richness over the past decade? To further understand whatever changes occur over this time period in the Research Triangle, we also ask: Has that change been consistent across all three main counties in the area? Was there a clear trend in the presence of species of concern across the decade? How did the popularity of eBird change in the RT over the 2010s? 
  
##### Analyses
  We utilized time series analyses to answer our research question including a time series of species totals for each of these counties: Durham, Orange, Wake and a time series of observer totals for each of the three counties. We also visualized Species of Greatest Conservation Need spp totals from 2010-2019 by county to support our findings.
